# Destinations App

Built with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app and Apollo graphql client.

Connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Theme and ColorMode containers so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.
